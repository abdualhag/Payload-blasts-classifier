# Payload-blasts-classifier
PyTorch implementation for payload blasts classifier

Getting Started:

This code assumes the availability of a NVIDIA GPU so CUDA acceleration can be utilized.

Macs do not use NVIDIA graphics and therefor cannot utilize GPU acceleration. 

The models can be trained on a CPU with no extra steps required. This is highly not recommended. 

The models can still be tested using a CPU.

To install all the necessary libraries, follow the description in this link: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
